# Kickstarter: uncovering hidden trends

# Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.


# Project objective

The main aim of this project is to organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past fund raising kickstarter projects to uncover hidden trends.

Using the Excel table provided, modify and analyze the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects as you attempt to uncover some market trends.

. Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the state column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, or canceled, or is currently live.
 
. Create a new column O called Percent Funded that uses a formula to uncover how much money a campaign made to reach its initial goal.
   
. Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column using a three-color scale. The scale should start at 0 and be a dark shade of red, transitioning to green at 100, and blue at 200.
  
. Create a new column P called Average Donation that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.

. Create two new columns, one called Category at Q and another called Sub-Category at R, which use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into two parts.
    
   # Category Stats
    
. Create a new sheet with a pivot table that will analyze your initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category.
    
. Create a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table you have created.


 # Subcategory Stats
 
. Create a new sheet with a pivot table that will analyze your initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per sub-category.
    
. Create a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent-category based on the table you have created.
    
. Create a new column named Date Created Conversion that will use this formula to convert the data contained within launched_at into Excel's date format.

. Create a new column named Date Ended Conversion that will use this formula to convert the data contained within deadline into Excel's date format.
    
 # Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 
. Create a new sheet with a pivot table with a column of state, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of state, and filters based on parent category and Years.

. Create a pivot chart line graph that visualizes this new table.


Create a report in Microsoft Word and answer the following questions.

     . Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
     . What are some limitations of this dataset?
     . What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

# Conclusion

As observed under category people participated in the fund campaigns did not seem to be contributing to journalism, in my opinion most journalists today are not more relevant to communities due to many reasons such as technological advancement where citizens could easily have access to relevant information online and the credibility of journalists on not reporting facts rather agenda driven skewed information. The number of backers who have contributed to the campaigns are from United States followed by United Kingdom and Canada.
Plays have been successfully funded under sub-category among others by far amount followed by rocks and documentary which were slightly funded. The campaign hits its highest success between May and June, then slightly drops through December. The lists of the countries were not orderly set that to assign currency symbols it was tedious. Moreover, the zero values in the data set resulted in error calculations particularly with average calculation where denominator must be used. Given this data set we can also be able to create statistical table to characterize the quantitate metrics.
